You are tasked with creating a puzzle in the style of the New York Times’ Connections game. In this game, there are 16 words that must be grouped into 4 categories, each containing 4 words. Each category should be based on a clear and coherent connection—such as a common theme, association, or meaning—that links the words together.

The rules are as follows:
1. The puzzle must contain exactly 16 unique words.
2. These words should be grouped into 4 categories with 4 words in each category.
3. Each category’s connection must be logical and discernible.
4. The entire puzzle should be solvable by identifying the underlying theme for each group.
5. The final output must be printed exactly in the JSON format provided below without any additional text.

Format:
{
        "Category Name": ["word1", "word2", "word3", "word4"],
        "Category Name": ["word1", "word2", "word3", "word4"],
        "Category Name": ["word1", "word2", "word3", "word4"],
        "Category Name": ["word1", "word2", "word3", "word4"]
}
